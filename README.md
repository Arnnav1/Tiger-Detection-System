### Tiger Detection System Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

**Overview:**

The Tiger Detection System is a cutting-edge application that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify and locate tigers within the reach of camera. This system is designed to enhance wildlife monitoring and conservation efforts by providing real-time detection capabilities.

**System Components:**

1. **Data Collection:**
   The system begins with an extensive dataset of images containing tigers in various environments and poses. This dataset is crucial for training the CNN to recognize the distinctive features of tigers amidst diverse backgrounds.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   Images are preprocessed to ensure consistency and enhance the quality of data fed into the CNN. This includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques to simulate different conditions and improve model robustness.

3. **CNN Architecture:**
   The core of the detection system is a CNN designed to effectively learn and identify features unique to tigers. The architecture may include:
   - **Convolutional Layers:** Extracting hierarchical features such as edges, textures, and patterns from the input images.
   - **Activation Functions:** Implementing ReLU or other activation functions to introduce non-linearity and help the network learn complex patterns.
   - **Pooling Layers:** Reducing dimensionality and retaining the most critical features, which aids in minimizing computational load and enhancing feature extraction.
   - **Fully Connected Layers:** Integrating features learned by convolutional layers to make final classification decisions.
   - **Archetecture I used:** I hvae used a pre-trained CNN model which is YOLO v8 n variant. YOLO v8 n is the best model for real-time image classification on smaller devices. YOLO was not trained to detect tiger so I fine-tuned the model to make it recognize tiger.

4. **Training:**
   The CNN is trained using a combination of labeled images and ground truth annotations. This phase involves optimizing the network’s parameters through techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize detection errors and improve accuracy.

5. **Detection and Localization:**
   Once trained, the CNN can process new images to detect the presence of tigers. The system provides bounding boxes around detected tigers, enabling precise localization within the image. This is achieved through object detection techniques integrated with the CNN.

6. **Performance Evaluation:**
   The system’s performance is evaluated based on metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics assess the accuracy of tiger detection and localization, ensuring the system meets the required standards for practical use.

7. **Integration and Deployment:**
   The CNN-based tiger detection model is integrated into a user-friendly monitoring system. This  include  camera, mobile bot, providing seamless and efficient tiger detection.

**Applications:**

- **Wildlife Conservation:** Enhances tracking and monitoring of tiger populations, aiding in conservation efforts and preventing poaching.
- **Ecological Research:** Provides valuable data for researchers studying tiger behavior and habitat usage.
- **Public Awareness:** Supports educational initiatives by offering real-time insights into tiger presence and movements.
